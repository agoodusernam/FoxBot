## FoxesHaven bot

This is a bot for the <a href="https://discord.gg/foxeshaven">FoxesHaven</a> Discord server, which provides useful and
fun commands.

If you want to use this bot on your own server, follow this guide:

Don't

Jokes aside, you probably shouldn't use this bot on your own server. It's not made to run for other servers and is 
specifically designed for the foxeshaven server. I have done my best to make it customisable, but if doing that would
have taken more time or added complexity, I didn't. There are still quite a few magic numbers and other server specific 
things in the code.

Just to note if you do want to run this in your server: It is only intended to run on one server per instance. 
I haven't tested, nor will I test it on multiple servers on one instance and it will likely not work properly if you try.

Primarily made for Python 3.12, so I can't guarantee it will work on other versions.

I have tried to make everything readable and typed properly, but it's still not perfect.
If you have any questions, send me a message on discord (@hl6) or open an issue.
